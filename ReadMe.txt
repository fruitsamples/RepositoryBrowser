Quartz Composer Application

RepositoryBrowser				Demonstrates how to use subclass of QCView, 
						QCCompositionPickerPanel, QCCompositionParameterView 
						and NSMatrix to browser Quartz Composer compositions 
						with different protocol.

Sample Requirements				The project was created using the Xcode running under 
						Mac OS X 10.6.x or later. 

About the sample				This sample uses a QCCompositionPanelView to display 
						the Quartz Composer compositions that conform to a 
						certain protocol selected by the user. The user can 
						select a composition by clicking on the composition 
						picker. The QCView will render the selected 
						composition, and the QCCompositionParameterView will 
						display the input parameters of the composition. When 
						the user change the composition protocol, the 
						application will update the contents in the 
						QCCompositionPanelView and display the newly selected 
						compositions.

Using the Sample				Open the project using the Xcode editor which can be 
						found in /Developer/Applications. Build the project and 
						run.
